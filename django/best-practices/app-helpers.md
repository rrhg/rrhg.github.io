As I was reading Daniel Feldroy's book "**Two Scoops of Django 3.x, Best Practices for the Django Web Framework**", in chapter 4 "Fundamentals of Django App Design", their argument about a helpers.py file was very compelling to me.  

"helpers.py What we call helper functions. These are where we put code extracted from views (Section 8.5: Try to Keep Business Logic Out of Views) and models (Sec- tion 6.7: Understanding Fat Models) to make them lighter. Synonymous with utils.py".  

<p>I find misago models, viewmodels, & views too complicated. That prompts me the idea to get some of the code out of those & put it in a helpers.py file.  Not in misago code, but in the Django apps I added to the project: questions & exams.</P
