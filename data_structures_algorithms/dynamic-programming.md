Some thoughts in my own words.  

1. Dynamically creating something  
    like updating a `list` of calculated values. 

1. Instead of many loops:   
    Save results. 

1. Is about finding some work that the naive (usually recursive) solution would repeat multiple times unnecessarily.
   1. Instead is better to store the result of that subproblem & reuse it to avoid extra computation.
1. Used on abstract problems that have the following properties:
   1. Optimal Substructure property.
      1. The problem can :
         1. Be broken in sub problems 
         1. There's an optimal way to solve the sub problems 
   1. Overlapping sub problems 
      1.
      1. 
1.
1. Types of problems:  
   1. Combinatoric (How many)
      1. How many steps from ...
   1. Optimization (Maximum or Minimum)
      1. Minimum steps needed...
   1. Yes or no.  
1. The optimal solution of the high level abstract problem 
   1. depends on the optimal solution 
      1. to the overlapping sub problems 

1. Memoization- store results 
   1. Memoized == cached
1. Optimize a problem by storing intermediaries 

1. Iteration vs Recursion
