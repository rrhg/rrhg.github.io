Some thoughts in my own words.  

1. Dynamically creating something  
    like updating a `list` of calculated values. 

1. Instead of many loops:   
    Save results. 

1. Is about finding some work that the naive (usually recursive) solution would repeat multiple times unnecessarily.
   1. Instead is better to store the result of that subproblem & reuse it to avoid extra computation.
1. Types of problems:  
   1. Combinatoric (How many)
      1. How many steps from ...
   1. Optimization (Maximum or Minimum)
      1. Minimum steps needed...
   1. Yes or no.  



1. Optimize a problem by storing intermediaries 

1. Iteration vs Recursion
