# O(1) 
* time does NOT change  
* space(ram) does NOT change  
> not dependent of input size.  
> time & space(ram) used by the algorithm itself does NOT change.   
> space(ram) used by the algorithm does not include space used by the input.   

AKA :
1. Constant Time
1. An algorithm is said to have a constant time when it is not dependent on the input data (n). 
1. space complexity of O(1) means that the space required by the algorithm to process data is constant; it does not grow with the size of the data on which the algorithm is operating.
1. use only O(1) memory
