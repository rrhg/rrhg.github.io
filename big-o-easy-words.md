AKA :
1. Constant Time
1. An algorithm is said to have a constant time when it is not dependent on the input data (n). 
1. space complexity of O(1) means that the space required by the algorithm to process data is constant; it does not grow with the size of the data on which the algorithm is operating.
1. use only O(1) memory   



# O(n)   
### linear   

* time increases at most linearly with the size of the input data   
* space(ram) 


# O(log n)   
### logarithmic     
* goes between O(1) & O(n) because it only uses a subset (but not all) of the input.   
* for example a tree binary search will only work with a few nodes
