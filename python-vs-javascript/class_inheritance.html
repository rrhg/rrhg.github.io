<div id="mroa" style="display: none;">Python : `class child(Parent1, Parent2) : ` will look first for a method in Parent1, if doesn't find it, then looks in Parent2</div>

           <span>Grade yourself</span>
                <select name="qqq"
                        value="vvvv"
                        >
                <option value="0">0</option>
                <option value="Python : `class child(Parent1, Parent2) : ` will look first for a method in Parent1, if doesn't find it, then looks in Parent2"

                    Python : `class child(Parent1, Parent2) : ` will look first for a method in Parent1, if doesn't find it, then looks in Parent2
                 </option>
               </select>

<div> How can we make the child call the method  of both parents ? By calling super(Parent1, self).method from the Parent1 method

    <script type="text/javascript"> 
        document.getElementById("mro").onclick = function() { 
  
            let d = document.getElementById("mroa")
            console.log(d.style.display)
            if (d.style.display === "none"){d.style.display = "block"}
            if (d.style.display === "block") {d.style.display = "none"}
  
        } 
  
    </script>
